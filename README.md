# CSC361
Coursework for UVIC's CSC361, Fall 2019

This course focused on networking and communications from the internet. Starting with the four layers of the internet, we progressed to optimal networking algorithms, such as Dijkstra's. Labs 1-3 are included in this repository, and are a great intro to the fundamentals of computer networking & communications. Also, the exercises folder contains weekly quizzes and assignments related to what was being taught that week. I received an A+ in the course.
