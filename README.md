# CSC361
Coursework for UVIC's CSC361, Fall 2019

This course focused on networking and communications from the internet. Starting with the four layers of the internet, we progressed to optimal networking algorithms, such as Dijkstra's. Labs 1-3 are included in this repository, and are a great intro to the fundamentals of computer networking & communications. I received an A+ in the course.
